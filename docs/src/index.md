# Probabilistic behavioural control

## Introduction
A central problem of control theory is to make a system with a complex interior present a unified, aggregate behaviour towards the outside world. Further, the aggregate behaviour should be close to some specification.

We approach this problem by giving a probabilistic notion of what it means to behave close to a specification. This probabilistic notion is based on defining what inputs a system typically encounters and defining a distance of the systems behaviour to the specified behaviour.
